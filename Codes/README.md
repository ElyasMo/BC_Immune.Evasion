# Step 1
## This step includes:
### scRNA-seq and proteomics data pre-processing
### Extracting malignant epithelial cell and CD+ T cells

# Step 2
## This step includes: 
### Generating pseudobulk dataset
### Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis across HER2+, ER+ and TNBC malignant epithelial cells
### Functional analysis based on DEG

# Step 3
## This step includes: 
### Weighted gene correlation network analysis
### Finding the gene and protein modules that embrace gene and proteins corresponding MHC II receptor using functional analysis

# Step 4
## This step includes: 
### Heatmaps, Dot plots, Box plots, and Violin plots related to MHC II markers, Cancer invasivness markers, CD4 T cells activation markers
