MHC II antigen presentation is the major pathway associated with progression-free survival between transcriptionally categorized TNBCs.The effect of MHC II on the 
prognosis of clinically stratified breast cancers (BC) based on receptors (i.e., estrogen, progesterone and HER2) has not been addressed. To study the MHC II in 
different BC subtypes, we conducted differential gene expression analysis following by network analysis across clinically stratified BCs. To do so, we analyzed 
transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and proteomics (quantitative proteomics from cell lines) profiles of malignant epithelial cells. We confirmed our findings in chromatin 
level using ATAC-seq data analysis.
